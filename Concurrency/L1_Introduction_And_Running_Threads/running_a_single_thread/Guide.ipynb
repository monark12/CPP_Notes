    "## Concurrency Support in C++11\n",
    "\n",
    "The concurrency support in C++ makes it possible for a program to execute multiple threads in parallel. Concurrency was first introduced into the standard with C++11. Since then, new concurrency features have been added with each new standard update, such as in C++14 and C++17. Before C++11, concurrent behavior had to be implemented using native concurrency support from the OS, using POSIX Threads, or third-party libraries such as BOOST. The standardization of concurrency in C++ now makes it possible to develop cross-platform concurrent programs, which is as significant improvement that saves time and reduces error proneness. Concurrency in C++ is provided by the thread support library, which can be accessed by including the <thread> header.\n",
    "\n",
    "A running program consists of at least one thread. When the main function is executed, we refer to it as the \"main thread\". Threads are uniquely identified by their thread ID, which can be particularly useful for debugging a program.

It is possible that by this point in time, the thread will also have finished.

As the thread exists within the process, it can no longer access those resources and thus not finish its execution as intended.\n",

    "## Detach\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now take a look at what happens if we donâ€™t join a thread before its destructor is called. When we comment out join in the example above and then run the program again, it aborts with an error. The reason why this is done is that the designers of the C++ standard wanted to make debugging a multi-threaded program easier: Having the program crash forces the programer to remember joining the threads that are created in a proper way. Such a hard error is usually much easier to detect than soft errors that do not show themselves so obviously.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some situations however, where it might make sense to not wait for a thread to finish its work. This can be achieved by \"detaching\" the thread, by which the internal state variable \"joinable\" is set to \"false\". This works by calling the `detach()` method on the thread. The destructor of a detached thread does nothing: It neither blocks nor does it terminate the thread. In the following example, detach is called on the thread object, which causes the main thread to immediately continue until it reaches the end of the program code and returns. Note that a detached thread can not be joined ever again.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/C2-3-A6.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the code above using `example_6.cpp` over on the right side of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers should be very careful though when using the `detach()`-method. You have to make sure that the thread does not access any data that might get out of scope or be deleted. Also, we do not want our program to terminate with threads still running. Should this happen, such threads will be terminated very harshly without giving them the chance to properly clean up their resources - what would usually happen in the destructor. So a well-designed program usually has a well-designed mechanism for joining all threads before exiting."
